        I'm Philipp Seidel, computer science enthusiast, former student and research assistant at KIT. My hobbies include programming, reading, skiing, traveling and camping, visiting the local sauna as well as politics and history. I have worked as a tutor before, helping others pass the software engineering course at KIT as well as a student assistant at the H²T institute at KIT. I'm currently taking a gap year and traveling. If you want to have a look at some of my past projects you came to the right place.
        <br/><br/>I'm excited to meet new people and ideas. If you are a nice person and would like to contact me, feel free to do so!
        <br/>Otherwise don't. :)
